# Codestrong 2012

The [Codestrong 2012](http://www.codestrong.com) conference application was created using Titanium Mobile
and the brand-spanking new MVC framework, Alloy, which was written on top of it to enhance developer productivity.

This app (and Alloy) still have quite a way to go.  If you're looking for the 2011 version using plain ol' JS,
there is a tag for that version downloadable in this repository.

This application and the associated source code are released under the Apache 2.0 open source license.  Code strong!

## Installing

The latest version of this application is not yet available on the app stores - when it is, we will put links here for
direct download, so you can install and use the app without importing the project.

## Building

The Codestrong application requires:

* Appcelerator Cloud Services keys
* Facebook application ID
* Twitter oAuth keys

...to be fully functional.  A sample tiapp.xml which contains placeholders for these values is included at the root of
this project directory.  Copy tiapp.sample.xml to tiapp.xml before importing to Studio or running.

## Credits

* Special thanks to Appcelerator, for making a platform where you can write native apps in JavaScript.  Dope.
* Current social sign in buttons provided by [Komodo Media](http://www.komodomedia.com/).
